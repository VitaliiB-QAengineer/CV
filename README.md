     Hello!
     My name is Vitaliy, at the moment I work as a master of quality assurance
of manufactured products in a field not related to IT. I want to apply for the
position of QA engineer at your company.
     I completed the "Software Testing" course at TechMission - IT education
Academi, gained practical skills in testing WEB-software, creating test
documentation and using test design techniques. I also acquired basic
FullStack development skills. You will find more detailed information in my
CV.
     Despite the fact that I do not have much experience in testing, I am very
passionate about this profession in the IT field and understand that new
information technologies are developing very quickly in the modern world.
This is a profession in which you always need to be in good shape and
develop together with innovative technologies, but I am ready for constant
improvement, for mastering new things and the maximum return of strength
and time on my part. This position will give me the opportunity to fully reveal
my potential and develop my skills to ensure the quality of software at a high
level.
     From my new job, I expect interesting tasks and cooperation with fellow
professionals in this field, who will be able to share their experience,
knowledge, and secrets of success, which will become motivators for me and
my future achievements.
     I have attached my CV and certificate to this e-mail. Thank you for taking
the time. I will be happy to receive feedback and answer your questions with
pleasure.
Sincerely,
Vitalii Bondarchuk
